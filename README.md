<p>This project aims to develop a Netflix movie recommendation system based on similarities within movies/ TV shows. The purpose of this 
study is to analyze a dataset from the Netflix database in order to analyze the similarities among the movies/ TV shows. We have all found 
ourselves scrolling endlessly looking for what to watch so this project might help with that. There is no information provided about the 
preferences of users, so what would be one's recommendation after watching a certain movie is what we are estimating.</p>

<h2> :book: K Means Clustering:</h2>

<p>The algorithm takes the unlabeled dataset as input, divides the dataset into k-number of clusters, and repeats the process until it does not find the best clusters. The value of k should be predetermined in this algorithm.

The k-means clustering algorithm mainly performs two tasks:

Determines the best value for K center points or centroids by an iterative process.
Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Those data points which are near to the particular k-center, create a cluster. </p>

<h2> :book: Natural Language Processing:</h2>

<p>Data preprocessing involves preparing and "cleaning" text data for machines to be able to analyze it. preprocessing puts data in workable form and highlights features in the text that an algorithm can work with. There are several ways this can be done, including:

* Tokenization: This is when text is broken down into smaller units to work with.

* Stop word removal: This is when common words are removed from text so unique words that offer the most information about the text remain.

* Lemmatization and stemming: This is when words are reduced to their root forms to process.</p>

<h2> :book: Cosine Similarity:</h2>

<p>Cosine similarity is one of the metric to measure the text-similarity between two documents irrespective of their size in Natural language Processing. A word is represented into a vector form. The text documents are represented in n-dimensional vector space.

Mathematically, Cosine similarity metric measures the cosine of the angle between two n-dimensional vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The Cosine similarity of two documents will range from 0 to 1. If the Cosine similarity score is 1, it means two vectors have the same orientation. The value closer to 0 indicates that the two documents have less similarity.

The mathematical equation of Cosine similarity between two non-zero vectors is:
